		<h2>About Townsville</h2>
<p>Townsville is a city on the north eastern  coast of Queensland, Australia. Townsville has a population of about 200,000 and growing steadily. Townsville was founded in 1864 as a port for the fledgling pastoral industry in North Queensland. Townsville lies approximately 1,350 kilometres (840 mi) north of Brisbane, and 350 kilometres (220 mi) south of Cairns . </p><br>
		<p>
		ownsville lies on the shores of Cleveland Bay, protected to some degree from the predominantly south-east weather. Cleveland Bay is mostly shallow inshore, with several large beaches and continually shifting sand bars. Magnetic Island lies 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) offshore, to the north of the city centre. Townsville is characterised as a tropical savanna climate. Owing to a quirk of geographical location.</p>
