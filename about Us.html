	<p>Townsville Community Music center just celebrated its 30th year in 2013. It has been constantly changing over the years to keep up with the taste and preferences of the people of Townsville. The Townsville music center was established  at a public meeting on May 24th . The then Deputy Mayor , Ken McElligott , opened the meeting and presented a cheque for $50 from the city council to cover initial petty cash, the center’s first funds. Since then Townsville music center has not only been fulfilling the music needs of the town but also has been provided them with yearly workshops and helping people learn and practice instruments.<br>

Townsville center got its first member Mira Henderson in 1984. She had extensive experience in community music work in England. She instigated a series of classes starting in1984 using the skills of people living in Townsville to enchance and encourage music learners of all ages. Our first director Kirsty veron was appointed in 1985.Kristy was very interested in teaching music to children and worked with Mira in the 1983 classes. She held this position until 1988 leading the new organization into a strong position in the Townsville arts community. 1985 didn’t only end there, the music centre produced Benjamin Brittens’s Noyes Fludde in St James Anglican Cathedral. <br>This involved hundreds of children and some of the best-known Townsville musicians. 1987 was the year of the first fund raising dinner. These dinners have now become a tradition as they were a wonderful mixture of good food  ,  good fine and good music. 19909 Arts Queensland had been a major funder Music Centre activities for a number of years but in this year they agree to provide funding on a three year basis. This made it much easier for the Centre to plan ahead and reduced the time that had to be spent on repetitive grant applications. This arrangement ran until 2004.
