<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> At the right bottom of the page well be adding a visitor counter that counts the number of people who visited the page. We have another signup button on the top right of the page that counts the number of people signed up as members.
Based upon these numbers and total number of signups and based on the number of ticket sales we can decide the success of the redesigned website.

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>We plan on targeting 2 specific age groups. These can be further divided into the younger and older generation. The younger generation consists of people under 35years of age.  they will be targeted with the newer genres. On the other hand the second group consists of people over the age of 35. They would be targeted with more of the older genres.</p>
